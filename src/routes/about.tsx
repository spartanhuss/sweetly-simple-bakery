            Lazy Cake started in 2021 in a tiny flat with a broken oven and a craving for chocolate. The first batch was an
            accident: melted butter, dark chocolate, biscuits crushed by hand, set overnight in the fridge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Friends asked for more. Then their friends. Today we make four cakes — slowly, in small batches, from a
            small kitchen on Linden Lane.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use 70% Belgian chocolate, French butter, and biscuits we'd happily eat on their own. Nothing else.
